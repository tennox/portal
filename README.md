## Installation

On any platform, you can get the [latest release manually](https://github.com/SpatiumPortae/portal/releases/latest), or simply run:

```bash
curl -sL https://portal.spatiumportae.com | bash
```
or
```bash
wget -qO - https://portal.spatiumportae.com | bash
```

On macOS or Linux, if you are using Homebrew:
```bash
brew install SpatiumPortae/homebrew-portal/portal
```

On Arch Linux (AUR):
```bash
yay -S portal-bin
```

Or using [nix](https://nixos.org/) (currently only on unstable channel):
```bash
nix profile install nixpkgs#portal
```

## How it works

### Sending files and folders

To send files:

```bash
portal send <file1> <file2> <folder1> <folder2> ...
```

The application will output a temporary password on the format `1-inertia-elliptical-celestial`.
<br><br>
The sender will communicate this password to the receiver over some secure channel.

### Receiving files and folders

To receive those files:

```bash
portal receive 1-intertia-elliptical-celestial
```

The two clients will establish a connection through a relay server. The file transfer will then commence with a direct or relayed connection, depending on what's possible.

## What it looks like ✨

The sender **(top)** sends a folder and three files to the receiver **(bottom)**.
<br><br>
In this case, as you can see in the event log, the transfer is made using **direct transfer**. That means
that the files are sent **directly** from one client to the other, _no middlemen involved_. 
<br><br>
As it happens, these computers are in the same local network, and `portal` recognizes this.

## Features

`portal` provides:

- End-to-end encryption using [PAKE2](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Password-authenticated_key_agreement)
- Direct transfer of files if possible (e.g. sender and receiver are in the same local network)
- Fallback to relay server if sender and receiver cannot connect directly
- Parallel gzip compression of files for faster and more efficient transfers
- Hosting your own relay (we'd appreciate it if you plan to send a lot of data!)
- Configurability and shell completions
- A shiny UI ⭐✨ to gaze your eyes upon while you wait for your files

### Completions

`portal` provides extensive <kbd>TAB</kbd> completions for the following shells:

- `bash`
- `zsh`
- `fish`
- `powershell`

To see installation instructions for your shell and platform, run:

```bash
portal completion [bash|zsh|fish|powershell] --help
```

#### Tip!

You probably didn't _quite_ catch the password Bob was screaming across the room.
<br>
You can use <kbd>TAB</kbd> completions to auto-complete passwords on the receiving end.

Press <kbd>TAB</kbd> when entering parts of your password...
```bash
portal receive 42-relative-parsec-s...
```

...and `portal` will suggest the possible words
```bash
$ portal receive 42-relative-parsec-s...

42-relative-parsec-supernova  42-relative-parsec-scatter    42-relative-parsec-solar      42-relative-parsec-spin       42-relative-parsec-static     
42-relative-parsec-sigma      42-relative-parsec-solid      42-relative-parsec-star       42-relative-parsec-storm      42-relative-parsec-system
```

__boom__. _supernova_.
```bash
portal receive 42-relative-parsec-supernova
```

### Flags

#### `Receiver`

- `-y/--yes`: overwrite existing files without `[Y/n]` prompts

#### `Relay`

- `-p/--port`: port to host the relay server on

#### `Sender` and `Receiver`

- `-r/--relay`: address of the relay server (`:8080`, `myrelay.io:1234`, ...)
- `-s/--tui-style`: the style of the tui (`rich` | `raw`)

#### `Sender`, `Receiver` and `Relay`

- `-h/--help`: output help messages for any command
- `-v/--verbose`: log debug info to file

### Configuration

`portal` places its configuration file in `$HOME/.config/portal/config.yml`.
<br><br>
As evident by the file extension, the config is a simple [YAML](https://yaml.org/) file with descriptive field names.

#### Default configuration
```yaml
relay: portal.spatiumportae.com
verbose: false
prompt_overwrite_files: true
relay_serve_port: 8080
tui_style: rich
```

### Hosting your own relay

The `portal` binary comes with a built-in relay server.
<br><br>
Spinning up your own relay is as easy as...
```bash
portal serve --port 1337
```

The server log output is `JSON`. Super-recommended to run it through [jq](https://github.com/stedolan/jq)!
```bash
portal serve --port 1337 2>&1 | jq .
```
...
```json
{
  "level": "info",
  "ts": "2023-02-28T02:57:45.310134+01:00",
  "caller": "rendezvous/server.go:77",
  "msg": "serving rendezvous server",
  "version": "v1.2.1",
  "address": ":1337"
}
```

### More details about the connection process

<summary>Technical details</summary>
  
### Technical details

The connection between the sender and the server is negotiated using a intermediary server (relay).
<br><br>
The relay server is used to negotiate a secure encrypted channel while never seeing the contents of files nor the temporary password.

The communication works as follows:

- `sender` connects to `relay`
- `relay` allocates a numerical ID to the sender and sends it to the `sender`
- `sender` generates and outputs the password (starting with the ID) to the terminal, hashes the password and sends it to the `relay`
- `receiver` hashes the password (which has been communicated over some secure channel) and sends it to the `relay`
- When both the `sender` and the `receiver` have sent the hashed password to the `relay`, the cryptographic exchange starts
- During the cryptographic exchange, the `relay`, well, relays messages from the `sender` to the `receiver` and vice-versa
- Once the cryptographic exchange is done, every message sent by the `sender` and `receiver` is encrypted, and the `relay` cannot see their contents
- The file transfer is about to begin, and can commence in two ways: 
  1. The `sender` and `receiver` are in the same local network or can be reached directly by IP in some other way
     - In this case, the `sender` and `receiver` will happily send the files to each other directly. The `relay` will close down for this connection.
  2. The `sender` and `receiver` are not on the same local network, or cannot reach each other directly. The transfer will go through the `relay`, which will continue to relay encrypted messages until the file transfer is completed

## Building from source

The [`Makefile`](Makefile) has everything you need. 
<br><br>
To build a binary containing all commands, run:
```bash
PORTAL_VERSION=v1.x.x make build
```

It's important to include `PORTAL_VERSION`, which is a [semantic version](https://semver.org/) string. This is needed
in order to validate senders and receivers against the relay, so transfers are disallowed
when on different major versions, for instance.
